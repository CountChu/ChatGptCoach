// TITLE is the title of the video.
//

subtitle-begin: TITLE 

//
// The subtitle-post command posts subtitles of the video.
// TIMESTAMP is MM:SS or HH:MM:SS.
// HH is hours. MM is minutes. SS is seconds. LINE is a line of the subtitle.
// Please just accept them, don't response them, and don't repeat them.
// I'll use the command many times.
//
