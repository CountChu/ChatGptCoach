post_begin: |
  The total length of the content titled "{title}" that I want to send you is too large to send in only one piece.

  For sending you that content, I will follow this rule:

  part_1 = """
  this is the content of the part 1
  """

  Then you just answer: "Received part 1"

  And when I tell you "ALL PARTS SENT", then you can continue processing the data and answering my requests.

text_begin: "part_{num} = \"\"\""
text_end: "\"\"\""

hint: "Please remember the part and answer: \"Received part {num}\""

post_end: ALL PARTS SENT
