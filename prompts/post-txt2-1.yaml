  The total length of the content that I want to send you is too large to send in only one piece.
  
  For sending you that content, I will follow this rule:
  
  [BEGIN PART 1/10]
  this is the content of the part 1 out of 10 in total
  [END PART 1/10]
  
  Then you just answer: "Received part 1/10"
  
  And when I tell you "ALL PARTS SENT", then you can continue processing the data and answering my requests.

text_begin: "[BEGIN PART {num}/{max}]"
text_end: "[END PART {num}/{max}]"

hint: "Please remember the part and answer: \"Received part {num}/{max}\""

post_end: ALL PARTS SENT
